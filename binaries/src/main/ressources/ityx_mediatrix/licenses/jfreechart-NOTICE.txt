JFreeChart has the following dependencies:

(a)  JDK 1.3.1 or higher - JFreeChart requires the Java2D and Collections
APIs, so it definitely won't work with JDK 1.1 (with a small amount of effort
you can probably get it to compile and run with JDK 1.2).  If you are using
JFreeChart to create applets, this means that you cannot rely on the JVM
integrated with Microsoft's Internet Explorer - your users will need to have
the Java 2 plug-in installed.  Most other browsers (e.g. Firefox, Mozilla,
Netscape, Konqueror) support JRE 1.4, 1.5 or 1.6.

(b)  JCommon - version 1.0.0 or later.  The runtime jar file (version 1.0.16)
is included in the JFreeChart distribution.  You can obtain the complete
source code for JCommon from:

    http://www.jfree.org/jcommon/

JCommon is licensed under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public Licence.

(c)  GNU JAXP (JDK 1.3 only) - a free implementation of the standard XML 
processing APIs for Java.

    http://www.gnu.org/software/classpathx/jaxp/

Classes in the org.jfree.data.xml package require this library, or
another JAXP v1.1 compliant parser.  The gnujaxp.jar file (from the
gnujaxp-1.0beta1.zip distribution) is included with JFreeChart.  GNU
JAXP is licensed under the terms of the GNU General Public License
with an additional library exception.

THIS LIBRARY IS ONLY REQUIRED BY JFREECHART IF YOU ARE USING JDK 1.3.

(d)  servlet.jar - classes in the org.jfree.chart.servlet
package require this file.  The JFreeChart distribution includes the 
servlet.jar file distributed with Tomcat 4.1.31.  Applicable license 
terms are published at:  

    http://java.sun.com/products/servlet/LICENSE   

(e)  JUnit - a unit testing framework (the junit.jar runtime file is
included in the distribution).  JUnit is licensed under the terms
of the IBM Common Public License.  You can find out more about JUnit
and/or download the latest version from:

    http://www.junit.org

The JUnit tests included with JFreeChart have been created using JUnit
4.3.1.
