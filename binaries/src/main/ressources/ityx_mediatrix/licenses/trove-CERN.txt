CERN licenses software for CERN staff and visitors for use at CERN. Most of CERN licences can be used by CERN staff on portables.
 For other products the CERN's Software Licence Office is available to assist in purchasing software for users at CERN.

As defined in Operational Circular Nr. 5, "Rules for Using CERN Computing Facilities" (see related link), users shall respect 
the proprietary rights related to CERN computing facilities, including software copyrights. Infringement of this obligation 
may constitute a breach of contracts concluded by CERN with outside suppliers of computers, networks, software and services.
 The user concerned shall be liable for damage resulting from any infringement of the circular.

We do not in any case license software for visitors for use on their portables at their home institute. 
If they add licensed software while at CERN, they are morally bound and legally obliged to remove it when they leave CERN.

This general rule needs to be checked against the specific licences in question (e.g., 
whether additional use on portables is permitted, "geographic conditions" -- running on a CERN machine while physically at CERN, etc.).
